# Divine
This repo is intended as a playground for experimenting with [Devise][l1], a gem for Rails that has become almost the *de facto* standard for implementing authentication.

## Setup
First and obvious step is generating the rails project itself and change into it:
```
$ rails new divine
$ cd divine
```
